Anthropology of Problem-Solving Strategies
Anthropology of Problem-Solving Strategies
A short position paper

Abstract
Problem-solving strategies such as trial-and-error, pattern recognition, working backwards, or acting things out are often presented as static, time-independent cognitive tools. This position paper argues that these strategies can also be understood as cultural practices, shaped by material conditions, social norms, educational traditions, and shared ways of making sense of the world. Viewing problem-solving through an anthropological lens helps explain why learners approach the same problem differently and opens new paths for more inclusive and meaningful education.

Core Claim
Problem-solving strategies are not only mental techniques; they are socially transmitted practices that evolve within communities, disciplines, and historical contexts.

Rationale
Across cultures and learning environments, people develop recurring ways of tackling uncertainty:

making marks, diagrams, or physical models;

simplifying situations before generalizing;

guessing, testing, and refining;

using analogies drawn from familiar activities.

These behaviors resemble cultural tools rather than fixed, time-independent methods. Anthropology has long studied how tools, rituals, and narratives shape human action; applying this perspective to problem-solving reveals strategies as learned, shared, and adaptable practices.

Educational Implications
Students’ “incorrect” approaches often reflect different strategic cultures, not lack of ability.
Teaching can focus on strategy comparison and translation, rather than enforcing a single canonical method.
Explicitly naming and valuing multiple strategies supports equity, especially in under-served contexts.

Position
An anthropological view of problem-solving complements cognitive science and mathematics education by restoring context, history, and practice. It reframes strategies not as static, time-independent abstractions, but as living cultural resources that can be observed, shared, and cultivated.

Key questions
How did people in pre-historic societies solve their problems, and what kinds of problems did they face?
Are these strategies still relevant today? If so, this suggests the existence of an inner core of problem-solving strategies that should be explicitly re-surfaced in contemporary educational endeavors.
